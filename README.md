# Human-Activity-Recognition-using-Accelerometer-sensor-data

# Problem: 

The main problem addressed in this project is the accurate recognition of human activities using data collected from wearable technology, specifically accelerometer sensors. Wearable devices, such as fitness trackers and smartwatches, generate vast amounts of sensor data that need to be analyzed to identify different physical activities. This capability is crucial for applications like health monitoring, fitness tracking, and personalized workout routines.

In this project, we analyze accelerometer data from wearable technology to extract time series features that characterize different activities such as walking, running, climbing up, and climbing down. By applying Natural Visibility Graph (NVG) and Horizontal Visibility Graph (HVG) methods, we identify network characteristics (average degree, network diameter, and path length) that distinguish between these activities. Additionally, we compute permutation entropy and complexity of the accelerometer signals to capture the dynamic properties of each activity.

Through this analysis, we aim to enhance the ability of wearable devices to monitor and recognize human activities more accurately, leading to improved health and fitness tracking capabilities. This in-depth activity recognition can support real-time feedback for users, contribute to personalized health insights, and aid in the development of more sophisticated activity monitoring algorithms in wearable technology.
