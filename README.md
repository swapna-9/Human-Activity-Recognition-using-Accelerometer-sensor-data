# Human-Activity-Recognition-using-Accelerometer-Sensor-Data

# Problem:

The project addresses the challenge of accurately recognizing human activities using data collected from wearable technology, specifically accelerometer sensors. Wearable devices, such as fitness trackers and smartwatches, generate vast amounts of sensor data that require analysis to identify various physical activities. This capability is crucial for applications like health monitoring, fitness tracking, and personalized workout routines.

This project involves analyzing accelerometer data from wearable technology to extract time series features that characterize different activities such as walking, running, climbing up, and climbing down. The Natural Visibility Graph (NVG) and Horizontal Visibility Graph (HVG) methods are applied to identify network characteristics, including average degree, network diameter, and path length, that distinguish between these activities. Additionally, permutation entropy and the complexity of the accelerometer signals are computed to capture the dynamic properties of each activity.
